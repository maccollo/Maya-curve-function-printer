A small but useful script. When making rigging machine scrips you often need to create some kind of control curve that has a particular shape.
After creating the curve you can run this script, and maya will print a python function that creates the same curve, which you can then copy into your rigging machine script.
The generated function has automatic knot vector generation, and the ability to change curve from closed to open without having to mess with the control points.
